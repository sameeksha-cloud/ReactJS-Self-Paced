# *Handling Form Submission*

- Default behavior built into the browser is that if a button, especially with type submit is pressed inside of a form, this overall form element will emit an event to which we can listen and that's the submit event. So, we can add submit listener *onSubmit* on the form element.

```JavaScript
 return 
    <form onSubmit={submitHandler}>
 ```

 - We can define a submitHandler function to store the different state slices and combine them into one object.

 ```JavaScript
 const submitHandler = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();

    const expenseData = {
      title: entitledTitle,
      amount: entitledAmount,
      date: new Date(entitledDate),
    };
```

> Note: event.preventDefault() is a function through this we can disable or prevent default behaviour of browser i.e. the page reloads because the browser actually automatically sends a request whenever a form is submitted to the server which is hosting this webpage.
