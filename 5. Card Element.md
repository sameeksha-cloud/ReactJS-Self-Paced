# Card

- Cards contain content and actions about a single subject. Material UI for React has this component available for us, and it is very easy to integrate.
- Whenever you combine components, you are using composition.
- composition is this props children feature which allows you to also create wrapper components which is a special type of component.

```JavaScript
import './Card.css';

const Card = (props) => {
  const classes = 'card ' + props.className; // classes constant which is haing card as a default class which is always applied, props.className- receive as a class name from outside is added to that string. 
  
  return <div className={classes}>{props.children}</div>;
}

export default Card;
```

```css
.card {
    border-radius: 12px;
    box-shadow: 0 1px 8px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.25);
  }<!--we were able to extract some code duplication from inside our CSS files into this separate wrapper component.--> 
  
```

- We can build wrapper components such as Card.
- One special prop which is built into React, which every component receives, even if you're never setting it explicitly ie.*props.childern*.
- Children is a reserved name.
- Value of this special children prop will always be the content between the opening and closing tags of your custom component.
